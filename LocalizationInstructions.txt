Localization Instructions

1) Create the yaml language files under /config/locales, one for each language you're going to support
en.yml for english
pt.yml for portuguese

2) Every string in you application should be passed to the t function

3) Uncomment the line below in the /config/locales/application.rb (sets default language)
config.i18n.default_locale = :en

4) Create method in application_controller.rb

before_action(:set_locale)

  def set_locale
  	I18n.locale = params[:locale]
  end

5) For every string in your code use the t function as such:

<%= t('welcome_to_rent_my_car') %>

then on the yaml file (step 1), add the localization of that string for each language

welcome_to_rent_my_car: "Welcome To Rent My Car"  in en.yml
welcome_to_rent_my_car: "Seja bem vindo ao Rent My Car" in pt.yml

6) then you can pass locale=pt or locale=en

Alternatively, if you set a route such as

get '/:locale' => 'pages#home'

thenn you can do:

http://localhost:3000/en or http://localhost:3000/pt
